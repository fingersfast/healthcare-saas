## Technical Tips for the Demo

1. **Using the PreviewImage Component**

   - Our custom `PreviewImage` component handles missing images gracefully
   - Use it whenever displaying screenshots:

     ```jsx
     import PreviewImage from "@/components/PreviewImage";

     // Then in your component:
     <PreviewImage
       src="/images/preview/dashboard-preview.jpg"
       alt="Dashboard Preview"
       width={600}
       height={400}
     />;
     ```

2. **Handling Network Issues**

   - If you experience network connectivity issues during the demo:
     - Use the static HTML pages in `/public/images/preview/`
     - Have screenshots saved on your local machine as backup
     - Prepare a PowerPoint backup with key screenshots

3. **Customizing for the Client**
   - To quickly customize the demo for specific hospitals:
     - Update the hospital name in LayoutWrapper.tsx

     - Adjust department names to match client's structure
